# Parkplorer: Your National Park Companion
___App development in progress. Subject to change.___

A companion app for the US National Parks. Including park hours, activities, and amenities, properties can be filtered by state, or searched by name. An optional user account can be made to save places to a wishlist, check off places visited, and mark places to re-visit.

>*Note: This app does not encompass all properties managed by the National Park Service. It specifically filters for properties with a designation of "National Park", "National Seashore", or "National Recreation Area".*

## How It's Made:

Tech Used: HTML, EJS, JavaScript, Express, Axios, Node.js, dotenv

Parkplorer is built using MVC architecture to allow the project to be more maintainable, and for ease of changes/updates to components as features are added.

## Our Goal:

Don't want to download a mobile app or sign up for yet another account? No problem. ParkPlorer can be used directly from a browser without any fuss.

Information for US National Parks can be found scattered all over the internet in various locations. This web app aims to condense the search for these properties, which can also be used when trip planning or daydreaming. Having the ability to filter through all the parks by the dtails important to you is more helpful than having to navigate a variety of sites.

## Planned Features:
- Authentication strategies
- Mapping locations by coordinates
- Filtering parks by available amenities
- Filtering parks by location (state)
